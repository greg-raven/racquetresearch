		<h2>ATP Equipment Rules</h2>
		<p>1.2 The Ball </p>
		<p>The ball shall have a uniform outer surface and shall be white or yellow in color. If there are any seams they shall be stitchless.</p>
		<p>The ball shall conform to the requirements specified (...) and be more than two ounces (56.7 grams) and less than two and one-sixteenth ounces (58.5 grams) in weight.</p>
		<p>(...)</p>
		<p>1.3 The Racquet </p>
		<p>Racquets failing to comply with the following specifications are not approved for play under the Rules of Tennis:</p>
		<p>a. The hitting surface of the racquet shall be flat and consist of a pattern of crossed strings connected to a frame and alternately interlaced or bonded where they cross; and the stringing pattern shall be generally uniform, and in particular not less dense in the centre than in any other area. The strings shall be free of attached objects and protrusions other than those utilized solely and specifically to limit or prevent wear and tear or vibration, and which are reasonable in size and placement for such purposes.</p>
		<p>b. For professional play, the frame of the racquet shall not exceed 29 inches (73.66 cm.) in overall length, including the handle, as from 1st January 1997. For non-professional play, the frame of the racquet shall not exceed 29 inches (73.66 cm.) in overall length including the handle, as from 1st January 2000. Until 1st January 2000, the maximum length of a racquet for non-professional play shall be 32 inches (81.28 cm.). The frame of the racquet shall not exceed 12 &frac12; inches (31.75 cm.) in overall width. The strung surface shall not exceed 15 &frac12; inches (39.37cm.) in overall length, and 11&frac12; inches (29.21 cm.) in overall width.</p>
		<p>c. The frame, including the handle, shall be free of attached objects and devices other than those utilized solely and specifically to limit or prevent wear and tear or vibration, or to distribute weight.</p>
		<p>Any objects and devises must be reasonable in size and placement for such purposes.</p>
		<p>d. The frame, including the handle, and the strings, shall be free of any device which makes it possible to change materially the shape of the racquet, or to change the weight distribution in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the racquet which would alter the swing moment of inertia, during the playing of a point.</p>
